* FORMATS REQ'D:
    * Board formats
        - <I> Input format
        - <E> Encoded format
        - <O> Output format

    * Moves have only one format: <M>

* PROGRAMS REQ'D:
    * I2E <I>
        - Read in a board in the input format and write its encoding to stdout
        - If the board isn't valid, returns a non-zero value

    * E2O <E>
        - Prints an arbritrary set of lines which are a human-viewable display

    * MOVES <Board>
        - Prints a list of <M>'s from the given position
        - Returns non-zero on error or if the board isn't valid

    * EME <E> <M>
        - Prints an <E> which results from applying the <M> to the given <E>
        - Returns non-zero if the move isn't valid

    
    * (OPTIONAL) CPU <E>
        - Prints an <M> indicating what the computer would do in the given
          position.
        - Returns non-zero on computer error
